# LDAP

This provides a way to deploy LDAP server and user administration (phpLDAPadmin) together, with some users and user groups for testing purposes. It can be adapted for production purposes.

By default, it sets up LDAP and the administration service. The user administration interface can be accessed on 172.31.0.1:6080.
